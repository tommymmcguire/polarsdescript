# This project uses a python template and the Pandas library to perform descriptive statistics for IDS 706. 
## In this project I created a function that counted the number of wine ratings (rows) and tested it with a function in test_main.py to assert that the data was correct. Then I calculated the average, median, and standard deviation of the rating of the wines and designed a histogram to show the distribution of wine ratings.
